Database concerns:
-Belongs to a House (fk)
-Assigned to a User (fk) >>> Can it be tasked to multiple users?
-Has a Task Title
-Has a description of what needs to be done
-Boolean for if it is done or not

Program Structure

User logs in with their credentials 
User's can create a House or join a House (need permission from 'landlord' or person who made the House)
Once associated with a House the User can take part in the tasks, finances, and etc for the house

Focusing on Tasks:
 Tasks have the schema described above in Database concerns
 
 User Interface:
     What can a user do? << Permissions Group setup by Landlord
         -A User can elect to close a task, once 50% of members of the house have done so it is closed, or if the landlord/owner of the task closes it, it's closed
         -Should we allow comments on the task? maybe eventually, for now let's keep it simple.

      General Idea for a Query to get tasks for a house:
          SELECT t.pkId,t.title,t.description,t.votes,COUNT(h.members) as numMembers FROM `tasks` t INNER JOIN `house` h ON t.fkHouseId=h.pkId
